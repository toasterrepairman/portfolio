*Shader designed in Blender*

## a sampling of programs I've made 

Welcome to my Github account! This is a pretty good place to check-in on the stuff I'm working on. I periodically update this page with samples of my work, so there is a good blend of new and old here. Generally it's only finished stuff, or at least software that's at-minimum viable.
